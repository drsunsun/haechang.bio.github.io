I’m Haechang Jung, an undergraduate researcher at INHA University, working on nano-enabled drug delivery systems.

My current focus is integrating in silico design with wet-lab validation—especially peptide/polymer carriers and albumin-binding strategies for half-life extension.

**Core interests**
- Nanomedicine & Drug Delivery Systems (DDS)
- In silico peptide binder design
- Translation-oriented platform building for biotech startups
