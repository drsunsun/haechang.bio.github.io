**Welcome to the 'J Bio Lab' Hompage.**<br/>
I am an undergraduate researcher at the Department of Biological Engineering, INHA University,
studying nano-enabled drug delivery systems.

My work centers on computational (in silico) design of delivery strategies
and their experimental validation in wet-lab settings,
particularly for peptide and polymer-based carriers.

My long-term goal is to develop translational drug delivery platforms
that connect molecular design with therapeutic performance.
